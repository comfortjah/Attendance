#Attendance
As it stands the process for taking attendance at Concordia is an annoyance and inconsistent. It can change year to year and requires professors to take head counts of their students. Most students show up to class on time, but if someone is late to class, they will miss the head count. If the professor didn’t notice a student who was in class, they will be marked absent. The professor has to keep track of these types of occurrences. This traditional method of attendance taking places unnecessary responsibility on the professor.

Rather than headcounts, students should become responsible for themselves. In this proposed solution, the student scans his or her student ID on an RFID reader when they enter the class. The professor will still have to enter the attendance into the CUW Banner system as he or she currently does, but will no longer need to take a head count. Instead the professor can look at his or her phone or a website for attendance records.

The Computer Science department could surely find an attendance system already created and ready to use. That’s not the only value of this project. There is something about do-it-yourself projects that are appealing. This project is being specifically designed and optimized for Concordia’s Computer Science department.

On top of that, one of the other values of the project is to make an impression on prospective students. This isn’t a revolutionary idea. This is exactly the kind of project a well studied Computer Science student could take on, if he or she were to attend Concordia.
